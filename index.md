AnyPackage is a cross-platform PowerShell extensible unified package management
interface. Learn one set of commands and manage any package manager. No longer
will users have to learn a package manager's unique syntax.

Package providers are the bridge between AnyPackage and the package manager. See
the [provider catalog](/docs/provider-catalog/provider-catalog.md) for the list
of package providers.

For lack of a better word AnyPackage is a meta package manager.
