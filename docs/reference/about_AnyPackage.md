# AnyPackage

## about_AnyPackage

## Short Description

Describes what the `AnyPackage` module is and how to use it.

## Long Description

`AnyPackage` is not a package management system in the traditional sense but
rather a way to interact with multiple package management systems. This lets
users have a single set of commands to interact with any package management
system instead of learning a unique set of commands.

## Package Providers

A package provider is the method used for `AnyPackage` to interface with a
specific package management system. For more information see
[about_Package_Providers](about_Package_Providers.md).

## Creating Package Providers

To create your own package provider see
[about_Creating_Package_Providers](about_Creating_Package_Providers.md).

## Finding Package Providers

Providers are shipped via PowerShell modules.
These modules can be identified by having the `AnyPackage` and `Provider` tags.

## Importing Package Providers

To import a package provider you will need to import the PowerShell module
containing the provider. For more information see [about_Package_Providers].

## Removing Package Providers

To remove a package provider you will need to remove the PowerShell module
containing the provider. For more information see
[about_Package_Providers].
